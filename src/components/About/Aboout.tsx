            <span className="book">My fascination with programming</span> is echoed in an analogy from a lecture by Professor Zammit of Malta University. While languages are like lakes - finite and fully graspable â€“ coding is an ocean, boundless in its depth and breadth of learning and exploration.
<br />
<br />
            One day, while deep-diving into JavaScript and HTML I came to a realisation: coding is not just a skill but a craft, a means to channel my creativity and problem-solving skills into tangible solutions that could make a real difference.
            <br />
            <br />
            Honed in the dynamic environment of tech startups and the ever-evolving world of social media, my problem-solving abilities lend a distinct perspective to my approach in software engineering. As I anticipate my next role as a developer, I look forward to diving deeper into this boundless ocean of technology, anticipating the thrill of new challenges and the reward of innovative solutions.
